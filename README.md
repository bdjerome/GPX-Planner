This is an application I made to solve a niche issue with regard to planning endurance events. In the past I have planned out races with my family by writing on a piece of paper and trying to mental math what time to meet me, along with notes for what to bring. As races get longer this becomes an even more involved process, so why not build something to make this race day planning easier. This app is still a work in progress and I have many more features and experimentation to be done.
