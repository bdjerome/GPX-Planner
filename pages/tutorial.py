                    GPX Pace planner was created to tackle the niche yet significant challenge of race planning faced by endurance athletes.
                    Traditionally race planning tools are non-existent or fall short when it comes to accounting for the complexities of elevation changes,
                    fatigue over long distances, and the need for crew/families to support athletes at various points along the route.
                    GPX Pace Planner fills this gap by providing a comprehensive solution that integrates GPS data,
                    pacing algorithms, and user configured parameters. The end result is a comprehensive tool that outputs 
                    important strategy details in a simple and easy to understand format.

        **Automatic Pace Correction for Elevation**
        
        The hill adjustment feature automatically modifies your pace based on elevation changes:
        
        - **Grade Calculation**: 
            - Determine grade per km segment
            - Multiply grade with a factor to slow pace uphill
                - If grade > 20 then factor is 0.12 otherwise 0.08
            - Add the calculated slowdown to the base pace for uphill segments
        - **Downhill**: Base pace is unaffected
        - **GPS Elevation Data**: Requires GPS elevation data to meaningfully adjust pace, if no elevation data is present no adjustments are made.
        
        *Perfect for trail races and hilly courses where maintaining even effort is more important than even pace.*

        - **Nicknames**: Custom labels for easy identification
        - **Cutoff Times**: Optionally set time limits for buffer calculations in the output
            - Time must be in HH:MM:SS 24 hour format so 00:00:00-24:00:00
